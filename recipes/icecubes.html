    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>For those who don't know how or have forgotten how to make ice when the ice tray is empty.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>A water source (clean one if possible)</li>
        <li>Some tray, with well-sized square indents, to individually contain above water.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Grab your ice cubes tray.</li>
        <li>Empty the ice cubes that are left in the tray, if there are any left, into the sink, leave alone to melt or run hot water on for a bit.</li>
        <li>Take the tray over to the sink and fill the holes, not the whole tray, with cold water. Hot water will freeze faster and be more clear.</li>
        <li>Open the freezer door.</li>
        <li>Place the water filled ice trays back in the freezer.</li>
        <li>Close the freezer door.</li>
        <li>Be sure to leave for around 4-6 hours at least to make sure it is frozen.</li>
        <li>It is a good idea to replace ice cubes that have sat for too long due to sublimation, if there are even any left.</li>
    </ol>
